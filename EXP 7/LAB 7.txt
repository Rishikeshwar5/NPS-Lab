7. Session Configuration of ARP and Static Routing using Cisco network switch and verify the connectivity. 

To configure ARP and static routing on Cisco switches, especially with a setup involving two switches and multiple PCs across VLANs, follow these steps. This setup will ensure that ARP entries are correctly created and that static routing is correctly configured to enable communication between VLANs. 

Scenario 

Switch 1 (Cisco 3560) with VLAN 10 

Switch 2 (Cisco 3560) with VLAN 20 

PCs: 

VLAN 10: PC A1, PC A2 

VLAN 20: PC B1, PC B2 

Network Topology 

Switch 1 (VLAN 10): 

PC A1: 192.168.10.2 

PC A2: 192.168.10.3 

VLAN 10 IP: 192.168.10.1 

Switch 2 (VLAN 20): 

PC B1: 192.168.20.2 

PC B2: 192.168.20.3 

VLAN 20 IP: 192.168.20.1 

Trunk Link between Switch 1 and Switch 2 

Step 1: Configure VLANs and Assign IP Addresses 

On Switch 1: 

Enter global configuration mode: 

enable 

configure terminal 

Create VLAN 10 and assign it to ports: 

vlan 10 

name Network_A 

exit 

 

interface range fastethernet 0/1 - 2 

switchport mode access 

switchport access vlan 10 

no shutdown 

exit 

Configure the VLAN 10 interface with an IP address: 

interface vlan 10 

ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0 

no shutdown 

exit 

Configure trunk port to Switch 2: 

interface fastethernet 0/24 

switchport mode trunk 

switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20 

no shutdown 

exit 

On Switch 2: 

Enter global configuration mode: 

enable 

configure terminal 

Create VLAN 20 and assign it to ports: 

vlan 20 

name Network_B 

exit 

 

interface range fastethernet 0/1 - 2 

switchport mode access 

switchport access vlan 20 

no shutdown 

exit 

Configure the VLAN 20 interface with an IP address: 

interface vlan 20 

ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0 

no shutdown 

exit 

Configure trunk port to Switch 1: 

interface fastethernet 0/24 

switchport mode trunk 

switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20 

no shutdown 

exit 

Step 2: Enable IP Routing 

Enable IP routing on both switches: 

On Switch 1 and Switch 2: 

ip routing 

Step 3: Configure Static Routing (if necessary) 

For this scenario, routing between VLANs on the same Layer 3 switch is handled internally, so static routes aren't necessary unless you need to route traffic to an external network. However, if you are configuring routing to another network or router, you would add static routes like this: 

ip route [destination_network] [subnet_mask] [next_hop_address] 

Step 4: Configure ARP 

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses. Cisco switches handle ARP automatically. However, you can manually add ARP entries if needed: 

Add ARP entry: 

On Switch 1: 

arp 192.168.20.2 00:11:22:33:44:55 

On Switch 2: 

arp 192.168.10.2 00:66:77:88:99:AA 

Replace 00:11:22:33:44:55 and 00:66:77:88:99:AA with the actual MAC addresses of the corresponding devices. 

Step 5: Configure IP Addresses on the PCs 

On PC A1: 

IP Address: 192.168.10.2 

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 

Default Gateway: 192.168.10.1 

On PC A2: 

IP Address: 192.168.10.3 

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 

Default Gateway: 192.168.10.1 

On PC B1: 

IP Address: 192.168.20.2 

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 

Default Gateway: 192.168.20.1 

On PC B2: 

IP Address: 192.168.20.3 

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 

Default Gateway: 192.168.20.1 

Step 6: Verify Configuration and Connectivity 

Ping from PC A1 to PC B1: 

ping 192.168.20.2 

Check ARP Table on Switches: 

show ip arp 

Check Routing Table on Switches: 

show ip route
